The scripts in this directory require the python amqp implementation
(the parent of the directory containing this README) to be in the
PYTHONPATH. This can be done with:

  export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_amqp>

Note that this file is found at <path_to_amqp>/demo/README.

The demo directory contains the following scripts:

  broker     -- a simple shell script to start the control broker
  controller -- the demo controller application
  client     -- the demo client application
  demo       -- a control script used to trigger actions

To use the demo take the following steps:

  1. Start the control broker, e.g.:

    ./broker -t frm

  2. Start the controller application, e.g.:

    ./controller

  3. Start as many client applications as you like. These should
     announce their presence to the controller via the control queue.
     The python client application can be started thusly:

    ./client

  4. Use the demo app to create links and send messages:

    ./demo create-link node1 ref=blah role=sender host=0.0.0.0 port=5672 user=demo password=demo
    ./demo send-message blah m1
    ./demo send-message blah m2
    ./demo send-message blah m3
    ./demo create-link node1 ref=bleh role=receiver host=0.0.0.0 port=5672 user=demo password=demo

The controller and client apps will print useful info on stdout when
interesting stuff happen. You can access the usage for any of the
scripts by using the -h option, e.g.:

  ./controller -h
