      <p>
        The AMQP type system defines a set of commonly used primitive types used for interoperable
        data representation. AMQP values may be annotated with additional semantic information
        beyond that associated with the primitive type. This allows for the association of an AMQP
        value with an external type that is not present as an AMQP primitive. For example, a URL is
        commonly represented as a string, however not all strings are valid URLs, and many
        programming languages and/or applications define a specific type to represent URLs. The AMQP
        type system would allow for the definition of a code with which to annotate strings when the
        value is intended to represent a URL.

    <doc title="Described Types">
      <p>
        The primitive types defined by AMQP can directly represent many of the basic types present
        in most popular programming languages, and therefore may be trivially used to exchange basic
        data. In practice, however, even the simplest applications have their own set of custom
        types used to model concepts within the application's domain, and, for messaging
        applications, these custom types need to be externalized for transmission.
      </p>

      <p>
        AMQP provides a means to do this by allowing any AMQP type to be annotated with
        a <i>descriptor</i>. A <i>descriptor</i> forms an association between a custom type, and an
        AMQP type. This association indicates that the AMQP type is actually a <i>representation</i>
        of the custom type. The resulting combination of the AMQP type and its descriptor is
        referred to as a <i>described type</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A described type contains two distinct kinds of type information. It identifies both an AMQP
        type and a custom type (as well as the relationship between them), and so can be understood
        at two different levels. An application with intimate knowledge of a given domain can
        understand described types as the custom types they represent, thereby decoding and
        processing them according to the complete semantics of the domain. An application with no
        intimate knowledge can still understand the described types as AMQP types, decoding and
        processing them as such.

    <doc title="Descriptor Values">

        Descriptor values other than symbolic (<xref name="symbol"/>) or numeric
        (<xref name="ulong"/>) are reserved, including numeric types other than
        <xref name="ulong"/>. The namespace for both symbolic and numeric descriptors is divided
        into distinct domains. Each domain has a defined symbol and/or 4 byte numeric id assigned by
        the AMQP working group. Descriptors are then assigned within each domain according to the
        following rules:

        An AMQP encoded data stream consists of untyped bytes with embedded constructors. The
        embedded constructor indicates how to interpret the untyped bytes that follow. Constructors
        can be thought of as functions that consume untyped bytes from an open ended byte stream and
        construct a typed value. An AMQP encoded data stream always begins with a constructor.

        An AMQP constructor consists of either a primitive format code, or a described format code.
        A primitive format code is a constructor for an AMQP primitive type. A described format code
        consists of a descriptor and a primitive format-code. A descriptor defines how to produce a
        domain specific type from an AMQP primitive value.

  <section name="compound-types" title="Compound Types" label="compound type notation and encoding">
    <doc>
      <p>
        AMQP defines a number of <i>compound types</i> used for encoding structured data such as
        commands, and controls. A compound type describes a composite value where each constituent
        value is identified by a well known named <i>field</i>. Each compound type definition
        includes an ordered sequence of fields, each with a specified name, type, and multiplicity.
        Compound type definitions also include one or more descriptors (symbolic and/or numeric) for
        identifying their defined representations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compound types are formally defined in the XML documents included with the specification.
        The following notation is used to define them:
      </p>

      <picture title="Example Compound Type"><![CDATA[

    <p>An example compound type.</p>

  <descriptor name="example:book:list" code="0x00000003:0x00000002"/>

  <field name="title" type="string" required="true" label="title of the book"/>

  <field name="authors" type="string" multiple="true"/>

  <field name="isbn" type="string" label="the isbn code for the book"/>
</type>
]]>
      </picture>

      <p>
        The <i>required</i> attribute of a field description controls whether a null element value
        is permitted in the representation. The <i>multiple</i> attribute of a field description
        controls whether a list of values is permitted in the representation. A single element of
        the type specified in the field description is always permitted, and lists if used MUST use
        an element type that matches the field description.
      </p>

      <p>
        AMQP compound types may be encoded either as a described list or a described map. In general
        a specific compound type definition will allow for only one encoding option. This is
        currently indicated by the naming convention of the symbolic descriptor. Map encodings have
        symbolic descriptors ending in ":map", and list encodings in ":list". (Note that there may
        be a more formal way of distinguishing in a future revision.)
      </p>
      <!-- TODO: see above note -->
    </doc>

    <doc title="List Encoding">
      <p>
        When encoding AMQP compound values as a described list, each element in the list is
        positionally correlated with the fields listed in the compound type definition. The
        permitted element values are determined by the type specification and multiplicity of the
        corresponding field definitions. When the trailing elements of the list representation are
        null, they MAY be omitted. The compound-value descriptor of the list indicates the specific
        compound type being represented.
      </p>

      <p>
        The described list shown below is an example compound value of the <i>book</i> type defined
        above. A trailing null element corresponding to the absence of an isbn value is depicted in
        the example, but may optionally be omitted according to the encoding rules.

    <doc title="Map Encoding">
      <p>
        When encoding AMQP compound values as a described map, the set of valid keys is restricted
        to symbols identifying the field names in the compound type definition. The value associated
        with a given key MUST match the type specification and multiplicity from the field
        definition. If there is no value associated with a given field, the key MAY be omitted from
        the map. This is the same as supplying a null value for the given key. The compound-value
        descriptor of the map indicates the specific compound type being represented.
