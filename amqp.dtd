  License
  =======
  JPMorgan Chase Bank & Co., Cisco Systems, Inc., Envoy Technologies Inc., iMatix Corporation, IONA
  Technologies, Red Hat, Inc., TWIST Process Innovations, and 29West Inc. (collectively, the
  "Authors") each hereby grants to you a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, nontransferable,
  nonexclusive license to (i) copy, display, distribute and implement the Advanced Messaging Queue
  Protocol ("AMQP") Specification and (ii) the Licensed Claims that are held by the Authors, all for
  the purpose of implementing the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. Your license and
  any rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from any Author if you
  bring any claim, suit, demand, or action related to the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
  Specification against any Author. Upon termination, you shall destroy all copies of the Advanced
  Messaging Queue Protocol Specification in your possession or control.

  As used hereunder, "Licensed Claims" means those claims of a patent or patent application,
  throughout the world, excluding design patents and design registrations, owned or controlled, or
  that can be sublicensed without fee and in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, by
  an Author or its affiliates now or at any future time and which would necessarily be infringed by
  implementation of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. A claim is necessarily
  infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it because there is no
  plausible non-infringing alternative for implementing the required portions of the Advanced
  Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensed Claims shall not
  include any claims other than as set forth above even if contained in the same patent as Licensed
  Claims; or that read solely on any implementations of any portion of the Advanced Messaging Queue
  Protocol Specification that are not required by the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
  Specification, or that, if licensed, would require a payment of royalties by the licensor to
  unaffiliated third parties. Moreover, Licensed Claims shall not include (i) any enabling
  technologies that may be necessary to make or use any Licensed Product but are not themselves
  expressly set forth in the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification (e.g., semiconductor
  manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object oriented technology, networking technology,
  operating system technology, and the like); or (ii) the implementation of other published
  standards developed elsewhere and merely referred to in the body of the Advanced Messaging Queue
  Protocol Specification, or (iii) any Licensed Product and any combinations thereof the purpose or
  function of which is not required for compliance with the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
  Specification. For purposes of this definition, the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
  Specification shall be deemed to include both architectural and interconnection requirements
  essential for interoperability and may also include supporting source code artifacts where such
  architectural, interconnection requirements and source code artifacts are expressly identified as
  being required or documentation to achieve compliance with the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
  Specification.

  As used hereunder, "Licensed Products" means only those specific portions of products (hardware,
  software or combinations thereof) that implement and are compliant with all relevant portions of
  the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification.

  The following disclaimers, which you hereby also acknowledge as to any use you may make of the
  Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification:

  THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS," AND THE AUTHORS MAKE NO
  REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR TITLE; THAT THE CONTENTS
  OF THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE; NOR THAT THE
  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD
  PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER RIGHTS.

  THE AUTHORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY USE, IMPLEMENTATION OR OF THE ADVANCED
  MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION.

  The name and trademarks of the Authors may NOT be used in any manner, including advertising or
  publicity pertaining to the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification or its contents
  without specific, written prior permission. Title to copyright in the Advanced Messaging Queue
  Protocol Specification will at all times remain with the Authors.

  No other rights are granted by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

  Upon termination of your license or rights under this Agreement, you shall destroy all copies of
  the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification in your possession or control.
