This project contains a partial prototype of AMQP 1-0 PR2. This
currently includes relatively complete components for framing and
codec.

Files:

  amqp.dtd      -- DTD for transport.xml and types.xml.

  codec.py      -- An implementation of the AMQP type system.

  framing.py    -- An implementation of the AMQP framing layer.

  mllib/        -- An XML parsing library used to load type definitions.

  README        -- This file.

  test.py       -- Some informal test code.

  transport.xml -- Definitions from the AMQP transport specification.

  types.xml     -- Definitions from the AMQP types specification. This
                   includes encoding and type definitions used by
                   codec.py.

  util.py       -- Common utilities.
