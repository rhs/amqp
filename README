This project contains a partial prototype of AMQP 1-0 PR2. This
currently includes relatively complete components for framing and
codec.

Files:

  codec.py       -- An implementation of the AMQP type system.

  framing.py     -- An implementation of the AMQP framing layer.

  mllib/         -- An XML parsing library used to load type definitions.

  operations.py  -- Classes representing all the operations and related
                    types defined by the AMQP transport specification.

  README         -- This file.

  test.py        -- Some informal test code.

  transport.xml  -- Definitions from the AMQP transport specification.

  types.xml      -- Definitions from the AMQP types specification. This
                    includes encoding and type definitions used by
                    codec.py.

  util.py        -- Common utilities.
